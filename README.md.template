# Housing Price Prediction

This project implements a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features such as guestroom, basement availability, and more. The data is preprocessed, categorical variables are encoded, and the results are visualized as a scatter plot showing actual vs predicted housing prices.

# Model Training and Prediction

The LinearRegression model is trained using features from the dataset and the target price variable. After training, the model makes predictions on the test set.
